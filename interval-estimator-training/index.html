<h1>Interval Estimator Training</h1>
<p>For techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_information_economics">Applied Information Economics</a>, the range of various values needs
	to be estimated. To do so properly, the people that perform the estimation should have been "calibrated", that is trained
	in estimating their own uncertainty. On this website, you can train yourself as an estimator.</p>

<div id="start">
	<button onclick="startCalibration()">Start calibration</button><br/>
</div>

<div id="estimation" style="display:none;">
	<div id="question">Question</div>
	<div>Please estimate a range of which you are 90% sure that the correct value lies within:</div>
	<form onsubmit="enterEstimate(); return false;">
		Lower bound: <input id="lower" type="number" title="A value of which you are 95% sure that the correct value is greater or equal" /> - Upper bound: <input id="upper" type="number" title="A value of which you are 95% sure that the correct value is less or equal" /><br/>
		<button type="submit">Enter estimate</button>
	</form>
</div>

<div id="output" style="display:none;">
Result:<br/>
You estimated <span id="correctEstimates">x</span> of 10 questions correctly. In the ideal case, you should have gotten 9 of 10 correct.
<div id="bad" style="background-color: red;">You seem to be overconfident in your estimates. Read the tips below and try again to improve your calibration.</div>
<div id="ok" style="background-color: yellow;">This is OK, but perhaps you are still slightly overconfident in your estimates. You can try again with a bit more conservative estimates.</div>
<div id="perfect" style="background-color: green;">Your result is perfect. You seem to be pretty well calibrated. But feel free to try again to check whether this was just luck.</div>
<div id="underconfident" style="background-color: yellow;">This is not bad, but perhaps you did not take enough risks when choosing your ranges. Please try again.</div>
