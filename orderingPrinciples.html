<h1>BBS Ordering Principles</h1>
<p>In my research on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSME.2017.28">ordering code changes for review</a> (together with Alberto Bacchelli and Kurt Schneider), I developed the following set of principles how to order a set of interrelated code changes to ease understanding:</p>

<ol>
<li>Group  related  change  parts  as  closely  as possible.</li>
<li>Provide information before it is needed.</li>
<li>In case of conflicts between Principles 1 and 2, prefer Principle 1 (grouping).</li>
<li>Closely related change parts form chunks treated as elementary for further grouping and ordering.</li>
<li>The closest distance between two change parts is "visible on the screen at the same time."</li>
<li>To satisfy the other principles, use rules that the reviewer can understand. Support this by making the grouping explicit to the reviewer.</li>
</ol>

<p>By replacing "change part" with "section/item/stuff" and "reviewer" with "reader", the principles are probably applicable to many other areas beyond change-based code review.</p>
