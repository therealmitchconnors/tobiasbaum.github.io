<h1>Study results</h1>

Thanks again to all participants of our study. Currently, we can only present the winners of the cash prizes and some raw results. More results will
be published later!

<h2>Winners</h2>
<p>
The participant with IDs starting like
<ul>
<li><i>13dzR..</i></li>
<li><i>13l3R..</i></li>
<li><i>nmpR..</i></li>
</ul>
have each won one of the EUR 200 cash prizes. Please contact me via mail (tobias.baum@inf.uni-hannover.de) so we can sort out the details.
Please provide your full participant ID in the mail so that we know you are really the participant we are looking for.
</p>
<p> The participant with ID <i>1551R..</i> gets a honorable mention (but no money) for having the highest overall review efficiency (0.622 defects/minute).
And <i>8quR..</i> has found the highest number of defects (21 of 22).</p>

<h2>Raw results</h2>
<p>Some of the raw results of the study can be <a href="rp/results.csv">downloaded in CSV format</a>. Among other things, the table contains
defect counts and time measured for each participant's session. The column "shortId" is the start of the ID you (hopefully) noted down at
the end of the experiment. If you have further questions don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>We only asked you to find correctness defects, but many people also remarked various flaws in the design and code style of the patches.
We did not count these as defects for methodological reasons, so they are not contained in the above-mentioned table. Nevertheless, we generally
agree to many of those remarks and would probably have remarked similarly in a real review setting.</p>
